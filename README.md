Ear and eyes are well specialized to extract the most important information from the crazy wave fields surrounding us - in realtime! Sound waves and electromagnetic waves are basicly very similar although the latter is a bit more complex as it has an orientation. But since our eyes don't care about that orientation, we do not as well, and so the two waves are similar in its structure for us.
Hmmm so what would happen if we could hear the electromagnetic waves? How does a specific color sound like? For that task we just had to mathematically abstract the electromagnetic waves and transform them to soundwaves - shouldn't be a big issue. Remember the analog radio? This actually is such a realtime-transformer. But the working frequency range of the radio is far to low for the eyes and are not recognized. Now let's assume, that we would have such a transformer for the optical frequency range. What would we hear while sitting in the garden? Do we hear green? Or blue? Actually we hear everything at the same time!:( If we want to hear the grass, we need to somehow only take the waves from this direction in to account.
